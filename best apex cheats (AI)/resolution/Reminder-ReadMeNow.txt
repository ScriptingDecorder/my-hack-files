You need to fix pixel coordination for these resolutions yourself
1600x900
1680X1050
3840x2160

2560x1440// This resolution is recently fixed by @tedted80
at this profile https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/members/2986286.html
but I dont have a screen bigger than 1920 so I couldn't check this fix myself.

This resolution files made when they removed the rampage and sentinal from game
And I didn't had access to them to fix them.So fix it yourself if its wrong.
(#I fixed rampage and sentinal on 1280x720/1366x768/1920x1080)

*Move them to resolution folder after you fix them*
+Fix gs(golden scope pixels)-(1 white pixel for each-( some of them are the same))
+Fix BloodhoundIcon pixel (choose a white pixel inside bloodhound ultimate icon (on bottom center of screen))
+Sniper golden scope pixels (1 white pixel)
+choose 3 diffrent unique white pixel for each Sniper 
+choose 3 diffrent unique white pixel for each shotgun
+***Remove the ,0 and ,1 please those were for ahk format)(I left them so you know you had to fix pixels with 0 color)
and replace the 0 pixels with a white pixel xFFFFFF
((((((see the format for 1280x720)))))))) 
+dont dont dont add any extra stuff to the script the program
will fail to load the resolution file. And keep the order of guns etc.

what I mean by choose a white pixel??????!!
first Download and install pmeter- enable color picker and coordinator
(You have to put the game in borderless_windowed if you want to use pmeter to pick the pixels) then go back to fullscreen if you want to play etc.
==>I mean you have to pick a white 0xFFFFFF pixel and replace its x,y coordination with pixels written in the file
bug: 1600x900 golden scope icons may not have a white 0xFFFFFF pixel - I'll fix it later
