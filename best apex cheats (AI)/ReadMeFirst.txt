Read everything before commenting you probably will get your answer faster.(And I will not answer if I wrote it already)

**This is a totally free program** . It takes me a lot of time to code and debug it so be grateful. Thank you!!

*I made it for myself too so I made the best possible thing for myself and I shared the same thing with you.

*This program is based on a project by "baseult" but its heavily modified and expanded by me.

***Set the game blind mode to Tritanopia , because aimassist can be distracted by damage numbers
(And i didnt't provide the slot color for supply guns on other blind modes yet)

**Change the program name (changemyname.exe) to something else.

*Use the program at you own risk, but this is not messing with the game memory and its just a fully external program so you are almost safe.

*If it doesn't found the suitable resolution file for your screen
you have to make a custom resolution file yourself or use one of provided resolutions.
I provided a templete of these resolutions but you need to fix pixel coordination for these resolutions yourself (its easy it will take 5-10 minute)
1600x900
1680X1050
3840x2160

2560x1440// This resolution is recently fixed by @tedted80
at this profile https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/members/2986286.html
but I dont have a screen bigger than 1920 so I couldn't check this fix myself.

(To make a custom resolution there are several video on the forum and there is a quick text tutorial
in resolution folder)

*** Work best onpotato graphic using Nvidia Inspector.

*** You definitly have to work on your own configs and tune the guns for your resolutions (using text files in gunSetting folder)

***If its shaky or swinging while aiming you have to reduce the humanizer for that gun.
(You can increase the humanizers up to 0.4 or more without shaking on 1280x720 so its one of the best resolution in my tests)

***If it drag the gun down you have to reduce "y fov" because it drags to red colors and probably there is a red color on your gun or
screen like low on ammo notification or etc.

***If AA confused by multiple distant enemies ,reduce gun's Fov X

***Comment with the phrase (It doesnt work!!) will not get an answer. You probably want to dissuade people using assist programs.
(if it doesn't work for you provide me with errors and reasons)

*This is a c# .net framework program so will need to install proper microsoft .net framework. but I think you all have it installed already.

*** Be polite and don't ruin it for everbody *** So I provide you with updates and new creative ideas.
